I wanted to start this blog with an easy problem in order to get something out there quicker. Problem #79 was a problem I hadn't solved yet and it had only a 5% difficulty rating. Nevertheless, I got stomped for a few hours. I realized I can solve it by hand, but the problem was finding an algorithm that will achieve the same thing with passable elegance.

Let's look at the problem:

> [Passcode Derivation (Problem 79)](https://projecteuler.net/problem=79):
>
> A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user for three random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode was 531278, they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the expected reply would be: 317.
>
> The text file, [keylog.txt](https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p079_keylog.txt), contains fifty successful login attempts.
>
> Given that the three characters are always asked for in order, analyse the file so as to determine the shortest possible secret passcode of unknown length.

code:

```javascript
import axios from "axios"

const data = await axios
  .get("https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p079_keylog.txt")
  .then(res => [...new Set(res.data.split("\n").filter(x => !!x))])
```

```javascript
const set = new Set(data.reduce((acc, x) => acc.concat(x.split("")), []))
```

```javascript
function getBottom(set, data) {
  let bottom = null
  for (let x of set) {
    if (data.every(s => x !== s[1] && x !== s[2])) {
      bottom = x
      break
    }
  }
  return bottom
}
```

```javascript
function getPossiblePassCode(data, set, passCode = []) {
  if (set.size === 0) return passCode
  const bottom = getBottom(set, data)
  const newData = data.map(s => s.replace(bottom, ""))
  set.delete(bottom)
  passCode.push(bottom)
  return getPossiblePassCode(newData, set, passCode)
}

console.log(getPossiblePassCode(data, set))
```
